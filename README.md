# Bash-Scripting

**About Shell : A shell is special user program which provide an interface to user to use operating system services. Shell accept human readable commands from user and convert them into something which kernel can understand. It is a command language interpreter that execute commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets started when the user logs in or start the terminal.**

**Command Line Shell : Shell can be accessed by user using a command line interface. A special program called Terminal in linux/macOS or Command Prompt in Windows OS is provided to type in the human readable commands such as “cat”, “ls” etc. and then it is being execute. The result is then displayed on the terminal to the user.**

**Shell Scripting : Usually shells are interactive that mean, they accept command as input from users and execute them. However some time we want to execute a bunch of commands routinely, so we have type in all commands each time in terminal.As shell can also take commands as input from file we can write these commands in a file and can execute them in shell to avoid this repetitive work. These files are called Shell Scripts or Shell Programs. Shell scripts are similar to the batch file in MS-DOS. Each shell script is saved with .sh file extension eg. myscript.sh. A shell script have syntax just like any other programming language. If you have any prior experience with any programming language like Python, C/C++ etc. it would be very easy to get started with it.**

### Why Do We Need Shell Scripts ? 
To avoid repetitive work and automation
System admins use shell scripting for routine backups
System monitoring
Adding new functionality to the shell etc.

### Advantages of shell scripts
The command and syntax are exactly the same as those directly entered in command line, so programmer do not need to switch to entirely different syntax
Writing shell scripts are much quicker
Quick start
Interactive debugging etc.

`` To Always Run the Script it's prefered to give permission to that file ! using Chmod +x ``
